# Part I: Introduction to R

## Problem 1: Installation

**Please install the following R/Bioconductor packages**

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install()
BiocManager::install("sva")

install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "HistData", "mvtnorm",
                   "reticulate"))
```


Please run this command (use `eval=TRUE`) to see if Bioconductor can work fine.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::valid() 
```


```{r libraries, message = FALSE}
# these packages are needed for HW2
# affy and affyPLM are needed to read the microarray data and run RMA
#library(sva) # for batch effect correction. Contains ComBat and sva.
library(ggplot2) # for plotting
library(dplyr) # for data manipulation
library(reticulate) # needed to run python in Rstudio
# these next two are not essential to this course
library(mvtnorm) # need this to simulate data from multivariate normal
library(HistData) # need this for data
```


## Problem 2: Getting help

You can use the `mean()` function to compute the mean of a vector like
so:

```{r mean}
x1 <- c(1:10, 50)
mean(x1)
x1
```

However, this does not work if the vector contains NAs:

```{r mean-na}
x1_na <- c(1:10, 50, NA)
mean(x1_na)
```

**Please use R documentation to find the mean after excluding NA's (hint: `?mean`)**

```{r problem2}
# your code here
mean(x1_na, na.rm = TRUE)
```

# Part II: Data Manipulation

## Problem 3: Basic Selection

In this question, we will practice data manipulation using a dataset
collected by Francis Galton in 1886 on the heights of parents and their
children. This is a very famous dataset, and Galton used it to come up
with regression and correlation.

The data is available as `GaltonFamilies` in the `HistData` package.
Here, we load the data and show the first few rows. To find out more
information about the dataset, use `?GaltonFamilies`.

```{r loadGalton}
install.packages("HistData")
library(HistData)
data(GaltonFamilies)
head(GaltonFamilies)
```

a. **Please report the height of the 10th child in the dataset.**

```{r problem3a}
# your code here
(tenth_child_height <- GaltonFamilies$childHeight[10])
#tenth_child_height
```


b. **What is the breakdown of male and female children in the dataset?**

```{r problem3b}
# your code here
(breakdown <- summary(GaltonFamilies$gender))
```

c. **How many observations (number of rows) are in Galton's dataset? Please answer this
question without consulting the R help.**

```{r problem3c}
(observations <- nrow(GaltonFamilies))
# your code here
```

d. **What is the mean height for the 1st child in each family?**

```{r problem3d}
# your code here
first_childs <- subset(GaltonFamilies, childNum == 1)
(mean_height <- mean(first_childs$childHeight))



```

e. **Create a table showing the mean height for male and female children.**
```{r problem3e}
# your code here
(mean_gener_height <- aggregate(childHeight ~ gender, data = GaltonFamilies, FUN = mean))

```

f. **What was the average number of children each family had?**

```{r problem3f}
# your code here
(average_childrennum_family <- aggregate(children ~ family, data = GaltonFamilies, FUN = function(x) mean(x[1])))
```

g. **Convert the children's heights from inches to centimeters and store
it in a column called `childHeight_cm` in the `GaltonFamilies` dataset.
Show the first few rows of this dataset.**

```{r problem3g}
# your code here
GaltonFamilies$childHeight_cm <- GaltonFamilies$childHeight * 2.54
head(GaltonFamilies)
```



## Problem 4: Spurious Correlation

```{r gen-data-spurious, cache = TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1234)
N <- 25
ngroups <- 100000
sim_data <- data.frame(group = rep(1:ngroups, each = N),
                       X = rnorm(N * ngroups),
                       Y = rnorm(N * ngroups))
head(sim_data)
```

In the code above, we generate `r ngroups` groups of `r N` observations
each. In each group, we have X and Y, where X and Y are independent
normally distributed data and have 0 correlation.

a. **Find the correlation between X and Y for each group, and display
the highest correlations.**

Hint: since the data is quite large and your code might take a few
moments to run, you can test your code on a subset of the data first
(e.g. you can take the first 100 groups like so):

```{r subset}
sim_data_first_100 <- sim_data[1:100, ]
sim_data_first_100$correlation <- by(sim_data_first_100, sim_data_first_100$group, FUN = function(x) cor(x$X, x$Y))
head(sim_data_first_100[order(sim_data_first_100$correlation, decreasing = TRUE), ])
```

In general, this is good practice whenever you have a large dataset:
If you are writing new code and it takes a while to run on the whole
dataset, get it to work on a subset first. By running on a subset, you
can iterate faster.

However, please do run your final code on the whole dataset.

```{r cor, cache = TRUE}
# your code here
sim_data$correlation <- by(sim_data, sim_data$group, FUN = function(x) cor(x$X, x$Y))
head(sim_data[order(sim_data$correlation, decreasing = TRUE), ])
```

b. **The highest correlation is around 0.8. Can you explain why we see
such a high correlation when X and Y are supposed to be independent and
thus uncorrelated?**

Because we cherrypicked the highest correlations among 100,000
correlations, it is just by chance that we found a few with such
a high correlation. We can see in the histogram below that most of
the correlations are around the expected value of 0.

```{r cor-hist, eval=F}
head(sim_data)
```


# Part III: Plotting

## Problem 5

**Show a plot of the data for the group that had the highest correlation
you found in Problem 4.**

```{r problem5}
# your code here
plot(sim_data$X[sim_data$group == 3987], sim_data$Y[sim_data$group == 3987])
```

Grading: 1pt.

## Problem 6


We generate some sample data below. The data is numeric, and has 3
columns: X, Y, Z.

```{r gen-data-corr}
library(MASS)
N <- 100
Sigma <- matrix(c(1, 0.75, 0.75, 1), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) * 1.5
means <- list(c(11, 3), c(9, 5), c(7, 7), c(5, 9), c(3, 11))
dat <- lapply(means, function(mu)
  mvrnorm(n = N, mu = mu, Sigma = Sigma))
dat <- as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, dat))
dat$Z <- as.character(rep(seq_along(means), each = N))
names(dat) <- c("X", "Y", "Z")
```

a. **Compute the overall correlation between X and Y.**

```{r problem6a}
# your code here
(correlation <- cor(dat$X, dat$Y))
```

b. **Make a plot showing the relationship between X and Y. Comment on
the correlation that you see.**

```{r problem6b}
# your code here
plot(dat$X, dat$Y, col = "red", xlab = "X", ylab = "Y",pch = 16, main = "X and Y scatter plot")

```

Your text answer here.
The correlation between X and Y is negative, meaning that as the values of X increases, the values of Y tend to decrease, and vice versa.
The correlation between X and Y is negative.

c. **Compute the correlations between X and Y for each level of Z.**

```{r problem6c}
# your code here
(each_z_correlation <- by(dat, dat$Z, function(subset) cor(subset$X, subset$Y)))

```

d. **Make a plot showing the relationship between X and Y, but this
time, color the points using the value of Z. Comment on the result,
especially any differences between this plot and the previous plot.**

```{r problem6d}
# your code here
plot(dat$X, dat$Y,  col = dat$Z, xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", pch = 16, main = "Scatter Plot of X and Y Colored by Z")

```

Your text answer here.
For each level of Z, there is a positive correlation between X and Y, while the previous graph showed an overall negative correlation between X and Y 

# Part IV: Bash practices

## Problem 7: Bash practices on Odyessy

Please answer the following question using bash commands and include those in 
your answer. Data are available at `/n/stat115/2020/HW1/public_MC3.maf`

Mutation Annotation Format ([MAF](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/File_Formats/MAF_Format/)) 
is a tab-delimited text file with aggregated mutation information. 
MC3.maf `/n/stat115/2020/HW1/public_MC3.maf` is a curated list of [somatic mutation](https://www.britannica.com/science/somatic-mutation) 
occured in many patients with different types of cancers from TCGA.

Since a complete MAF file contains far more information than we need, 
in this problem we will focus on part of it.

```
Chromosome	Start_Position	Hugo_Symbol	Variant_Classification
10	123810032	TACC2	Missense_Mutation
10	133967449	JAKMIP3	Silent
11	124489539	PANX3	Missense_Mutation
11	47380512	SPI1	Missense_Mutation
11	89868837	NAALAD2	Missense_Mutation
11	92570936	FAT3	Silent
12	107371855	MTERFD3	Missense_Mutation
12	108012011	BTBD11	Missense_Mutation
12	117768962	NOS1	5'Flank
```

In  `/n/stats115/2020/HW1/MC3/public_MC3.maf`, `Chromosome` and `Start_Position` 
together specifies the genomics location where a location has happened. 
`Hogo_symbol` is the overlapping gene of that location, and 
`Variant_Classification` specifies how it influences downstream biological 
processes, e.g. transcription and translation.

Please include your bash commands and the full output from bash console 
with text answer to the questions.


a. How many lines are there in this file? How many times "KRAS" gene has emerged?

```{r q7a, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
# your bash code here
file_path=/home/ola/Documents/task/project1/public_MC3.maf
line_count=$(wc -l < "$file_path")
echo "Line count is: $line_count"

kras_count=$(grep -w -c "KRAS" "$file_path")
echo "KRAS emerged $kras_count times"
```

```
your bash output here
Line count is: 9
KRAS emerged 0 times
```

b. How many unique `Variant_Classification` are there in the MAF? Please 
count occurence of each type and sort them. Which one is the most frequent? 

```{r q7b, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
# your bash code here
file_path=/home/ola/Documents/task/project1/public_MC3.maf
counts=$(cut -f 4 "$file_path" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr)
count_num=$(echo "$counts" | wc -l)
most_frequent=$(echo "$counts" | head -n 1)
echo -e "There are $count_num unique Variant_Classification in the MAF, and they include \n$counts"
echo "The most frequent is$most_frequent"
```

```
your bash output here
There are 4 unique Variant_Classification in the MAF, and they include 
      6 Missense_Mutation
      2 Silent
      1 Variant_Classification
      1 5'Flank
The most frequent is      6 Missense_Mutation
```

Your text answer:
There are 4 unique Variant_Classification in the MAF, and they include 
      6 Missense_Mutation
      2 Silent
      1 Variant_Classification
      1 5'Flank
The most frequent is 6 Missense_Mutation

c. What are the top FIVE most frequent genes? Please provide 
the bash command and equivalent Python command. If you are a PI 
looking for a gene to investigate (you need to find a gene with potentially 
better biological significance), which gene out of the top 5 would you 
choose? Why?

```{r q7c, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
# your bash code here
file_path=/home/ola/Documents/task/project1/public_MC3.maf
gene_counts=$(cut -f 3 "$file_path" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr)
echo -e "The top FIVE most frequent genes are: \n$gene_counts" | head -n 5

```

```
your bash output here
The top FIVE most frequent genes are: 
      1 TACC2
      1 SPI1
      1 PANX3
      1 NOS1
```

Equivalent python command:

```{r q7cpy, engine="python", eval=FALSE}
# your python command here
```

```
your python output here
```

Yor text answer:


d. Write a bash program that determines whether a user-input year ([YYYY]) is 
a leap year or not (all years that are multiples of four. If the year is 
centennial and not divisible by 400, then it is not a leap year). 
The user input can be either positional or interactive. 
Please include the content of your shell script here and test on 
1900/2000/2002, does your code run as expected?

```{r q7d, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
# your bash code here
if [ $# -eq 1 ]; then
    year=$1
else
    # Prompt the user for input interactively
    read -p "Enter a year [YYYY]: " year
fi

# Check if the year is a leap year
if [ $((year % 4)) -eq 0 ] && [ $((year % 100)) -ne 0 ] || [ $((year % 400)) -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "$year is a leap year."
else
    echo "$year is not a leap year."
fi


```



# Part V. High throughput sequencing read mapping

We will give you a simple example to test high throughput sequencing
alignment for RNA-seq data. Normally for paired-end sequencing data,
each sample will have two separate FASTQ files, with line-by-line
correspondence to the two reads from the same fragment. Read mapping
could take a long time, so we have created just two FASTQ files of one
RNA-seq sample with only 3M fragments (2 * 3M reads) for you to run STAR
instead of the full data. The files are located at
`/n/stat115/2020/HW1`. The mapping will generate one single output
file. Make sure to use the right parameters for single-end (SE) vs
paired-end (PE) modes in BWA and STAR.

Please include the commands that you used to run BWA and STAR in your
answers.


## Problem 8: BWA

1. Use BWA (Li & Durbin, Bioinformatics 2009) to map the reads to the
Hg38 version of the reference genome, available on Odyssey at
`/n/stat115/HW2_2019/bwa_hg38_index/hg38.fasta`. In 
`/n/stat115/HW1_2020/BWA/loop`, you are provided with three `.fastq` 
files with following structure (`A_l` and `A_r` are paired sequencing reads 
from sample_A). Write a for loop in bash to align reads to the reference 
using BWA PE mode and geneterate output in SAM format.

How many rows are in each output `.sam` files? Use SAMTools on the output
to find out how many reads are mappable and uniquely mappable 
(please also calculate the ratio). Please include full samtools output 
and text answer.


```{r 8, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
# please provide the content of your sbatch script (including the header)
```

```
samtools output
```

You text answer

## Problem 9: STAR alignment

1. Use STAR (Dobin et al, Bioinformatics 2012) to map the reads to the
reference genome, available on Odyssey at
`/n/stat115/HW1_2020/STARIndex`. Use the paired-end alignment mode and
generate the output in SAM format. Please include full STAR report.  
How many reads are mappable and how many are uniquely mappable?

```{r 9, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
# please provide the content of your sbatch script (including the header)
```

```
Log file from STAR
```

2. If you are getting a different number of mappable fragments between
BWA and STAR on the same data, why?

# Part VII: Dynamic programming with Python

## Problem 10 

Given a list of finite integer numbers, 
Write a python script to maximize the Z where Z is the sum of the
numbers from location X to location Y on this list. Be aware, your
algorithm should look at each number ONLY ONCE from left to right.
Your script should return three values: the starting index location X, 
the ending index location Y, and Z, the sum of numbers between index 
X and Y (inclusive).

For example, if A=[-2, 1, 7, -4, 5, 2, -3, -6, 4, 3, -8, -1, 6, -7, -9, -5], 
your program should return (start_index = 1, end_index = 5, sum = 11) 
corresponding to [1, 7, -4, 5, 2].

Please test your program with this example and see if you can get the 
correct numbers.

Hint: Consider dynamic programming.

```{python dynamic-programming, eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}

#Kadane's algorithm

def maximum_subarray(nums):
    maximum_sum = float('-inf')
    current_sum = 0
    start_index = 0
    end_index = 0
    temp_index = 0

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        current_sum += nums[i]

        if current_sum > maximum_sum:
            maximum_sum = current_sum
            start_index = temp_index
            end_index = i

        if current_sum < 0:
            current_sum = 0
            temp_index = i + 1

    return start_index, end_index, maximum_sum

# Test case
A = [-2, 1, 7, -4, 5, 2, -3, -6, 4, 3, -8, -1, 6, -7, -9, -5]

start_index, end_index, subarray_sum = maximum_subarray(A)

print("start_index =", start_index)
print("end_index =", end_index)
print("sum =", subarray_sum)

```
